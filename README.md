# tJavaModule01spr26

Read and Study Chapter 2 in the text, and set up your IDE.

Watch the first 30 minutes of the Tech with Tim "Intro to Java Programming" video. 

Code up the following ten programs that are confidence-building exercises aligned with Chapter 2 of the textbook. Create a new project for each of these programs. Key in everything, using your IDE's code-complete feature of course, and ask ChatGPT for help when necessary, but DO NOT copy and paste ChatGPT's Java source code into your programs. Use the Scanner class for user input and experiment with TextIO if you want an additional challenge. 

Study the approved solutions for similar programs that are at the end of Chapter 2. Use w3schools for help with new concepts and include the URL of the w3schools lesson as a comment in your Java program.

Push all of your Java source code to the remote repo (GitHub Classroom) for this module.
